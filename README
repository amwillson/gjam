This repo contains code written by AM Willson and I Shuman for Shuman et al. (in prep). The code uses GJAM to investigate the vegetation-environment relationship during the period of European settlement of the U.S. Midwest, as documented via the Public Land Surveys of the 19th century.

**Data** and **intermediate outputs** from processing steps required to run the analysis code are available in the GJAMDATA subdirectory. **Outputs** of the GJAM model are available in the out subdirectory. Any data or outputs not included in the repository are available upon request at this time. Processing for the data inputs to this repository are available from the following repositories:
  -https://github.com/ian-shuman/GJAMCovariates.git: produces point-level reconstructions of environmental covariates
  -https://github.com/ian-shuman/PLS_products.git: provides point-level reconstructions of vegetation distributions

The bulk of the repository is housed in the R subdirectory. The scripts within the R subdirectory are ordered according to the sequence of steps that should be taken to recreate the anlaysis. Descriptions of each step are as follows, and should be run in the following order:

0.SummaryFigures.R: This script produces the figures given in the supplement of Shuman et al. (in prep) that summarize the response and driver variables in space
  -Input: Environmental covariates (xdata), and ecosystem and taxon level repsonse data (ydata) from the GJAMDATA/ subdirectory. **The inputs that are loaded at the top of the script are saved from step 1. Step 0 is the only out-of-sequence step because it is not part of the analysis and only serves as data (not analysis) visualization**
  -Output: None saved. Figures of reconstructed vegetation and environmental covariates

0.SummaryFigures_OOS.R: This script produces the figures given in the supplement of Shuman et al. (in prep) that summarize the response and driver variables of withheld data for performing out-of-sample validation. The script is an exact mirror of 0.SummaryFigures.R but for out-of-sample validation data
  -Input: Ecosystem and taxon level out-of-sample data from the GJAMDATA/Withheld for Validation/ subdirectory. **The inputs that are loaded at the top of the script are saved from step 2. Step 0 is the only out-of-sequence step because it is not part of the analysis and only serves as data (not analysis) visualization**
  -Output: None saved. Figures of reconstructed vegeation and environmental covariates
  
1.Process.R: Takes tables of response (ydata) and driver (xdata) variables and formats them according to the format required by the gjam() function. The script conducts simple data checks before saving the output in an RData file.
  -Input: xdata (drivers) and ydata (response variables) from CSVs specific to each management area as described in the methods of Shuman et al. (in prep)
    -X input files contain 19 columns:
      -uniqueID: an identifier for each corner within a given dataframe. When binded together, the uniqueID must be combined with the management area to get a unique corner identifier across management areas

  -Y input files contain 82 columns
    -uniqueID: an identifier for each corner within a given dataframe. When binded together, the uniqueID must be combined with the management area to get a unique corner identifier across management areas
    -chainstree, chainstree2, chainstree3, chainstree4: distance of each tree at a given corner to the corner. There can be between  1 and 4 trees at a given corner, so chainstree2-chainstree4 can be NA. Units are chains. Currently not used in the analysis

2.Process_OOS.R: This script is identical to 1.Process.R but formats the out-of-sample data that will be used to validate the model in step 8.
  -Input: xdata (drivers) and ydata (response variables) from CSVs in the GJAMDATA/Withheld ofr Validation/ subdirectory specific to each management area as described in the methods of Shuman et al. (in prep). Structure is identical to the inputs of 1.Process.R
  -Output: GJAMDATA/processed_xydata.RData: a RData file with the xdata_oos and ydata_oos (oos denoting out-of-sample data) dataframes with all management areas combined
    -xdata: 24699 out-of-sample corners of observations of 17 variables. Variables are identical to xdata from 1.Process.R
    -ydata: 24699 observations of 28 variables. The fewer number of variables is because some rare taxa that are later combined into "other hardwood" or "other conifer" categories are absent.

3.Combine_marea.R: This step takes the output of 2.Process_OOS.R and matches each management area from the out-of-sample data with the nearest in-sample management area using Euclidean distance. This is necessary because the out-of-sample prediction must have only random effect groups that were present in the in-sample dataset.
  -Inputs: 
    -GJAMDATA/Withheld for Validation/validation_processed_xydata.RData: output file from 2.Process_OOS.R with xdata_oos and ydata_oos
    -GJAMDATA/processed_xydata.RData: output file from 1.Process.R with in-sample xdata and ydata
  -Outputs:
    -GJAMDATA/Withheld for Validation/validation_processed_xydata_fixmarea.RData: xdata_oos and ydata_oos. Identical to the xdata_oos and ydata_oos in GJAMDATA/Withheld for Validation/validation_processed_xydata.RData except that the contents of the marea (management area) column were replaced with management areas in the in-sample xdata

4.Reduce.R: This script takes the output of 1.Process.R and reduces the number of individual taxa by grouping black gum, sweet gum, and black gum/sweet gum; poplar, tulip poplar, and poplar/tulip poplar; and any uncommon taxa with either other hardwood or other conifer. This reduces the dimensionality of the response variable to reduce the probability of overfitting and improve parameter inference.
  -Inputs:
    -GJAMDATA/processed_xydata.RData: the RData file saved from 1.Process.R with xdata and ydata dat aframes
  -Outputs:
    -GJAMDATA/processed_xydata_2.RData: xdata and ydata with reduced taxonomic groups
      -xdata: 78224 observations of 17 variables. Identical to the xdata output saved in GJAMDATA/processed_xydata.RData. Saved again here for convenience down the pipeline
      -ydata: 78224 observations of 15 variables. Presence or absence (1/0) of each taxonomic group
        -No.tree: corners where no trees were observed, as defined above
        -Poplar.tulip.poplar: presence/absence of taxonomic groups poplar, tulip poplar, and poplar/tulip poplar in the original dataset
        -Black.gum.sweet.gum: presence/absence of taxonomic groups black gum, sweet gum, black gum/sweet gum in the original dataset
        -Other.conifer: presence/absence of taxonomic groups bald cypress, pine, tamarack, cedar/juniper in the original dataset

4.Reduce_ecosystem.R: This script takes the output of 3.Reduce.R and further reduces the dimensions of the response variable to include only three ecosystem states: prairie, savanna, and forest. This allows for an analysis of both biome-level and community-level drivers of vegetation distribution.
  -Inputs: GJAMDATA/processed_xydata_2.RData
  -Outputs: GJAMDATA/processed_xydata_2_ecosystem.RData
    -xdata: 78224 observations of 17 variables. Identical to the xdata output svaed in GJAMDATA/processed_xydata.Rdata. Saved again here for convenience down the pipeline
    -ydata: 78224 observations of 3 variables. Presence or absence (1/0) of each biome
      -Prairie: Present at any corner only including presence of No.tree in the original dataset
      -Savanna: Present at any corner including presence of oak and/or hickory but not any other tree taxon in the original dataset
      -Forest: Present at any corner including any tree taxon other than exclusively oak and/or hickory

5.Reduce_OOS.R: This script is identical to 4.Reduce.R for the out-of-sample data. The script takes the output of 3.Combine_marea.R as the input.
  -Inputs: GJAMDATA/Withheld for Validation/validation_processed_xydata_fixmarea.RData
    -Output from 3.Combine_marea.R
  -Outputs: GJAMDATA/Withheld for Validation/validation_processed_xydata_fixmarea_reduced.RData
    -xdata_oos: 24699 observations of 18 variables. Identical to the xdata saved in GJAMDATA/Withheld for Validation/validation_processed_xydata_fixmarea.RData. Saved again for convenience down the pipeline.
      -type: new column saved from 3.Combine_marea.R denotes that this is out-of-sample data
    -ydata_oos: 24699 observations of 15 variables. Presence/absence (1/0) of each taxonomic group
      -No.tree: corners where no trees were observed, as defined above
      -Poplar.tulip.poplar: presence/absence of taxonomic groups poplar, tulip poplar, and poplar/tulip poplar in the original dataset
      -Black.gum.sweet.gum: presence/absence of taxonomic groups black gum, sweet gum, and black gum/sweet gum in the original dataset
      -Other.conifer: presence/absence of taxonimc groups bald cypress, pine, tamarack, cedar/juniper in the original dataset

5.Reduce_OOS_ecosystem.R: This script is identical to 4.Reduce_ecosystem.R for the out-of-sample data. It takes the output of 5.Reduce_OOS.R as the input.
  -Inputs: GJAMDATA/Withheld for Validation/validation_processed_xydata_fixmarea_reduced.RData
  -Outputs: GJAMDATA/Withheld for Validation/validation_processed_xydata_fixmarea_reduced_ecosystem.RData
    -xdata_oos: 24699 observations of 18 variables. Identical to the xdata saved in GJAMDATA/Withheld for Validation/validation_processed_xydata_fixmarea.RData. Saved again for convenience down the pipeline
    -ydata_oos: 24699 observations of 3 variables. Presence/absence (1/0) of each biome
      -Prairie: Present at any corner only including presence of No.tree in the original dataset
      -Savanna: Present at any corner including presence of oak and/or hickory but not any other tree taxon in the original dataset
      -Forest: Present at any corner including any tree taxon other than exclusively oak and/or hickory

6.Run: This step is a folder with the run scripts for each of four simulation types. There are four subdirectories of 5.Run, each of which contains both the R script and a job submission script for running the simulations on the University of Notre Dame cluster computing system. The R scripts are set up in the same way and differ in two ways: (1) the data files that are called as inputs and (2) the covariates that are named as independent variables in the gjam formula.
  -Files:
    -All_taxa~all_cov_ASPECT calls the output of Reduce.R as the input. The formula includes all covariates: mean preicpitation, mean temperature, topographic slope, Saga Wetness Index, presence of hydric soils, presence of a floodplain, soil CaCO3 concentration, cation exchange capacity, soil sand content, soil clay content, soil water content, and topographic direction (north, south, east, west, or no aspect). The response variable is the joint presence or absence of each taxon.
    -All_taxa~all_cov_NOASPECT is the same as All_taxa~all_cov_ASPECT except that it does not include the topographic direction as an independent variable.
    -Reduced_taxa~all_cov_ASPECT calls the output of Reduce_ecosystem.R as the input. The formula includes all covariates: mean precipitaiton, mean temperature, topographic slope, Saga Wetness Index, presence of hydric soils, presence of a floodplain, soil CaCO3 concentration, cation exchange capacity, soil sand content, soil clay content, soil water content, and topographic direction (north, south, east, west, or no aspect). The response variable is the joint presence or absence of the three ecosystems (prairie, savanna, and forest).
    -Reduced_taxa~all_cov_NOASPECT is the same as Reduced_taxa~all_cov_ASPECT except that it does not include the topographic direction as an indpendent variable.
    -All the submit.sh files have identical specifications as follows:
      -M tag denotes which email information about the status of the job should go to
      -m tag denotes to send emails when a job is aborted, begins, or ends
      -pe smp 10 tag denotes submitting the job to 10 parallel cores on a single node
      -q long tag specifies the job should be submitted to the long queue
      -N tag specifies the name of the job
  -Inputs:
    -GJAMDATA/processed_xydata_2.RData for community level runs (All_taxa~all_cov_ASPECT and All_taxa~all_cov_NOASPECT)
    -GJAMDATA/processed_xydata_2_ecosystem.RData for biome level runs (Reduced_taxa~all_cov_ASPECT and Reduced_taxa~all_cov_NOASPECT)
  -Outputs:
    -RData file in the output folder containing entire global environment for each run of GJAM. This ensures that all information used as input to GJAM is saved alongside the output, which is in the out data object in the global environment. Each RData file is saved in a subdirectory specific to the run type (All_taxa~all_cov_ASPECT, All_taxa~all_cov_NOASPECT, Reduced_taxa~all_cov_ASPECT, or Reduced_taxa~all_cov_NOASPECT)
    
7.Combine.R: GJAM only allows for one chain to be run at a time. Given that the model is a Bayesian model relying on MCMC, multiple chains are useful for estimating the full uncertainty of the model and to reduce the impact of initial chain values on inference. We therefore ran the model 4 times using identical specifications in one of the simulations given in 6.Run and we then combine the chains into a more usable format here.
  -Inputs: Input can be changed to load the output of any run from 6.Run. This can be changed by modifying the type object using the four available options specified at the top of the script. The input is always the entire global environment saved for each run of GJAM, but the specific input depends on the type of run you want to manipulate.
  -Outputs: RData object named combined.RData in the specified subdirectory of the out/ folder. The subdirectory is specified in the type object at the beginning of the script. Each combined.RData object contains the following
    -bFacGibbs: dataframe with 3200 samples. Number of columns differs according to the number of parameters in the specified model. Columns are beta coefficient estimates standardized for X with correlation scale for W. See Clark et al. (2017) for more information. Includes intercepts and coefficient estimates for "yes" and "no" of binary variables (hydric and floodplain). Also includes chain (1-4) and iter (201-1000) columns for the MCMC chain and MCMC iteration. iter starts at 201 because burn-in has already been removed.
    -bgibbs: dataframe with 3200 samples. Number of columns differs according to the number of parameters in the specified model. Columns are beta coefficient estimates standardized for X. See Clark et al. (2017) for more information. Includes intercepts but only "yes" of binary variables (hydric and floodplain). Also includes chain (1-4) and iter (201-1000) columns for the MCMC chain and MCMC iteration. iter starts at 201 because burn-in has already been removed.
    -bgibbsUn: dataframe with 3200 samples. Number of columns differs according to the number of parameters in the specified model. Columns are unstandardized beta coefficient estimates. Includes intercepts but only "yes" of binary variables (hydric and floodplain). Also includes chain (1-4) and iter (201-1000) columns for the MCMC chain and MCMC iteration. iter starts at 201 because burn-in has already been removed.
    -fSensGibbs: dataframe with 3200 samples. Number of columns differs according to the number of parameters in the specified model. Columns are the covariance between X and the responses they elicit from Y. See Clark et al. (2017) for more information. Also includes chain (1-4) and iter (201-1000) columns for the MCMC chain and MCMC iteration. iter starts at 201 because burn-in has already been removed.
    -sgibbs: dataframe with 3200 samples. Number of columns differs according to the number of parameters in the specified model. Colummns are covariances between response variables. See Clark et al. (2017) for more information. Also includes chain (1-4) and iter (201-1000) columns for the MCMC chain and MCMC iteration. iter starts at 201 because burn-in has already been removed.

8.Visualize.R: This script produces figures used in Shuman et al. (in prep) for both community-level and biome-level runs, depending on the input called into the script and the designation of "all" (community-level) or "reduced" (biome-level) at the beginning of the script. The script uses the output of 7.Combine.R, but the specific input depends on the simulation of interest.
  -Inputs: combined.RData file from the specified subdirectory of the out/ folder. The file is specified by modifying line 11.
  -Outputs: none. Figures produced

9.Predict_OOS.R: This script uses the model fit of one of the simulations from 6.Run to predict the out-of-sample data. The type of prediction here predicts the response variable only from the environmental covariates and does not take into account the covariance between taxa or ecosystem states. Visualization is included in the same script.
  -Inputs: 
    -The global environment RData file for the first chain of any of the four model runs. The first chain is specified as follows, using the All_taxa~all_cov_ASPECT model run type as an example: out/All_taxa~all_cov_ASPECT/all_taxa-all_cov_ASPECT_1.RData
    -The out-of-sample data that fits the model run type. One of the following
      -GJAMDATA/Withheld for Validation/validation_processed_xydata_fixmarea_reduced.RData: for All_taxa model runs
      -GJAMDATA/Withheld for Validation/validation_processed_xydata_fixmarea_reduced_ecosystem.RData for Reduced_taxa model runs
  -Outputs: none saved. This is the last step, so all analysis of the validation is done in the same step

9.Predict_OOS_conditional.R: This script is similar to 9.Predict_OOS.R and uses the same inputs. The difference is that the type of prediction implemented in this script accounts for the covariance between taxa or ecosystem types, which we hypothesize will improve prediction.
  -Inputs:
    -The global environment RData file for the first chain of any of the four model runs. The first chain is specified as follows, using the All_taxa~all_cov_ASPECT model run type as an example: out/All_taxa~all_cov_ASPECT/all_taxa-all_cov_ASPECT_1.RData
    -The out-of-sample data that fits the model run tyep. One of the following
      -GJAMDATA/Withheld for Validation/validation_processed_xydata_fixmarea_reduced.RData: for All_taxa model runs
      -GJAMDATA/Withheld for Validation/validation_processed_xydata_fixmarea_reduced_ecosystem>Rdata for Reduced_taxa model runs
  -Outputs: this is a terminal step, but the validation is computationally intensive, so the out-of-sample prediction for the All_taxa~all_cov_NOASPECT and Reduced_taxa~all_cov_NOASPECT model run types are saved as intermediate outputs as follows:
    -out/cond_pred_all_taxa.RData: conditional prediction with All_taxa model run type
    -out/cond_pred_reduced_taxa.RData: conditional prediction with Reduced_taxa model run type

utils.R: This script contains utility functions for the code. Specifically, there is a function for manually calculating the Gelman Rubin diagnostic for assessing chain convergence because our output is not in the proper format to use the default functions available in R. I additionally removed any identical chains (usually 2/4) from the output prior to calculating the diagnostic statistic. The identical chains are an artefact of the gjam function and cannot be avoided to the authors' knowledge. Removing the identical chains offers a more conservative view of chain convergence.
